      <h2><strong>About our mentorship projects.</strong></h2>
      <p>Mentorship is a valuable relationship where a more experienced person guides and supports the development of a less experienced individual. This partnership, often spanning personal or professional growth, offers guidance, knowledge sharing, and career advice. A mentor helps mentees navigate challenges, develop skills, and achieve their goals by providing a sounding board and offering a different perspective. Mentorship is a two-way street, benefiting both the mentor and mentee through skill development and expanded networks. </p>
